This notebook demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting and classifying diseases in guava fruits. The dataset used in this notebook is the **Guava Fruit Disease Dataset** from Kaggle, which includes three classes: [**Anthracnose**](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/gotpests/diseases/anthracnose.htm#:~:text=Anthracnose%20is%20a%20group%20of,attacks%20only%20specific%20tree%20species.), [**Fruit Fly**](https://www.fruitfly.co.za/sanitation-and-host-plants/#:~:text=All%20fruit%20fly%2Dinfested%20and,infestation%20and%20should%20be%20removed.), and **Healthy Guava**.

The dataset can be accessed from the following link: [Guava Fruit Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asadullahgalib/guava-disease-dataset/code?datasetId=6003511). Download the dataset into your cloned repository before running the code.

Key tasks covered in this notebook:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Image augmentation for improved generalization
- Training a CNN model
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
